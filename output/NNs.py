# ## Formal Definition
# - A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, composed of artificial neurons or nodes
# - It changes its structure based on input and output and can compute a target class given an input vector

""" Slide cell """
# %% [markdown] lang="en" tags=["slide"]
# ## Application: Image Recognition
# - Neural Networks are widely used for image recognition tasks, as they can parse hierarchical features

# ## Limitations
# - Neural networks can be complex and computationally expensive
# - They require large volumes of labeled data 
# - They can be sensitive to irrelevant features

# ## Hands-On Workshop
# - Implement a simple neural network for a classification problem
# - Analyze its performance using different metrics
# - Tweak its parameters and structure to enhance its performance
