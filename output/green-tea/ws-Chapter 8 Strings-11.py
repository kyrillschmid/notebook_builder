Welcome to the Mini-Workshop on Strings! In this session, we will explore how strings in Python can be manipulated and analyzed. Let’s dive into an interesting exercise that will test your understanding of string handling in Python.

## Mini-Workshop: String Reversal

### Overview

Strings in Python are sequences of characters that can be indexed and sliced. This characteristic makes it possible to traverse and manipulate them in various creative ways. In this exercise, we will attempt to write a function that checks whether one string is the reverse of another string.

### Your Task

You have been given a function `is_reverse(word1, word2)` that supposedly returns `True` if `word2` is the reverse of `word1`. However, the current implementation contains errors, and it’s your job to debug and fix it.

Here is the original, erroneous version of the function:

```python
def is_reverse(word1, word2):
    if len(word1) != len(word2):
        return False
    
    i = 0
    j = len(word2)

    while j > 0:
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True
```

### Steps to Fix the Function

1. **Identify and Fix the Errors**: The function `is_reverse` should return `True` if one string is the reverse of the other but currently throws an `IndexError`. Identify the issues causing this error and apply the necessary fixes.
   
2. **Refine the Function**: Make sure the function correctly returns `True` when `word2` is the reverse of `word1` and `False` otherwise. Consider edge cases such as different lengths of strings and empty strings.

3. **Testing**: After fixing the function, test it with several pairs of strings to ensure its correctness. For example:

```python
assert is_reverse("pots", "stop") == True
assert is_reverse("hello", "olleh") == True
assert is_reverse("Python", "nohtyP") == True
assert is_reverse("python", "Python") == False
assert is_reverse("words", "sword") == False
assert is_reverse("", "") == True
```

### Guidance on Fixing the Function

- Remember that string indices in Python are 0-based, and the index `len(word2)` will be out of range. Consider how to correctly initialize your indices for traversal.
- Think about why the loop might not be iterating the correct number of times and how the initial conditions for `i` and `j` contribute to this behavior.
- Debugging involves not just fixing syntax errors but also ensuring that the logic of your code matches the intended outcome. It may help to manually trace through your code's execution or use print statements to observe the values of variables at different points in your code.

### Your Implementation

Go ahead and try to implement and test the corrected version of `is_reverse` below. Good luck!

```python
# Implement your fixed version of is_reverse here
def is_reverse(word1, word2):
    # Your fixed code here
```

Test your fixed function with the provided test cases and any additional ones you consider.
