# ## Mini-Workshop: Introduction to Python Errors

# %% [markdown] lang="en"
#
# As part of this exercise, we'll explore common syntax errors in Python and learn to interpret and fix them. Let's start with experimenting with `print` function errors.

# %% [markdown] lang="en"
# **Exercise 1**: In the following cell, intentionally make mistakes with the `print` function calls as described below. Observe and note down the errors you get:
# - Leave out one of the quotation marks in a string.
# - Leave out both quotation marks in a string.
# - Misspell the word `print`.
# - Leave out one of the parentheses, or both.

# %%
# Try out the intentional mistakes here. For example:
print("Hello, world!
# (You can add more cells as needed to try each mistake)

# **Exercise 2**: What happens if you:
# - Use a minus sign to make a negative number?
# - Put a plus sign before a number?
# - Try to use leading zeros in a number, like `09` or `011`?
# - Have two values with no operator between them?
# 
# Experiment in the cells below:

# ## Mini-Workshop: Using Python as a Calculator

# %% [markdown] lang="en"
# **Exercise 3**: Start the Python interpreter in this Jupyter notebook and use it as a calculator to solve the following problems:
# 1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
# 2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.
# 3. If you run a 10-kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?

# After you've attempted the exercises, review and discuss the errors and results with peers or mentors. Understanding common errors and learning to calculate and manipulate numbers are foundational skills in programming.
